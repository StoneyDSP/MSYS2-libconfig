This library will need to implement a complete set of checks and associated pre-processor macros/defines needed to build the components of our custom <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP/MSYS2-pacman">'pacman' package manager for Msys64</a> using CMake and the <a href="https://github.com/StoneyDSP/MSYS2-toolchain">'MSYS2-toolchain'</a> project.

This will need to handle dependencies appropriately, which might otherwise be resolved at component-level - meaning, our components will need to 'include' this config library in some way as a means of resolving their individual dependencies. This can be done by exporting the config library targets and config/version handlers using CMake's import/export utilities.
